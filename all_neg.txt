[343] "i want to think about from your perspective, how do you see your ability to use generative ai, maybe to iterate features and functionality faster and potentially narrow the gap with some of the upmarket players that maybe customers want to move on to hubspot, but some of those features and functionality may be missing."                                                                                                                   
[344] "are you seeing kind of a sweet spot in kind of where ai is being implemented in terms of either i don't know, type of design, gate count or is it kind of a broad-based usage of ai?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
[345] "and then one on gen ai, in terms of trying to understand how bing and bard may be kind of behaving, is, for their content, they probably don't need to learn from multiple different sites."
